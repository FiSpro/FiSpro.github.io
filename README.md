## Welcome to my GitHub Page

My name is Filip, I am 23 years old. I am currently living in Koper, Slovenia and studying Computer Science at Famnit, University of Primorska.
I am working on my Final Thesis titled "Manipulating and augmenting digital content through physical counterpart", which involves making 3D models from objects, augmenting them and displaying informaiton about them, so it is a mix of Multimedia and Augmented Reality.

I use my free time to play guitar and hang out with my friends.
