## Welcome to my GitHub Page

My name is Filip, I am 23 years old and I am currently living in Koper, Slovenia. I graduated in Computer Science at [UP FAMNIT](https://www.famnit.upr.si/en/) in 2023 and got a degree: B.Sc. in Computer Science.
My Final Thesis, titled "Manipulating and augmenting digital content through physical counterpart", involved making 3D models from historical objects connected to Koper, augmenting them and displaying information about them, so it was a mix of Multimedia and Augmented Reality.

From July to August 2023, I was part of the Summer Camp at [Dinit](https://www.dinitcs.com/), which gave me an opportunity to learn and introduced me to new technologies and challenges.
From August to December 2023, I completed an internship at the same company as an Application Developer.

I use my free time to play guitar and hang out with my friends.
